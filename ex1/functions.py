'''
In this module you will define several functions.

Please document your functions according to
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt

# Example so that you can see a passing test

# Define a function named to_tuple that takes three arguments and returns a
# tuple of these three arguments.

# argument is a list of numbers and the second argument is the number n to
